Review of Laplace Transform, system modeling principles and reduction to mathematical forms. Block diagrams, open- and closed-loop systems, feedback control, Single-Input / Single-Output (SISO) control systems, state-space representation of Multiple-Input / Multiple-Output (MIMO) control systems. Response of first- and second-order systems to standardized aperiodic inputs, transient response, steady-state errors. Complex-plane representation of open-loop systems. Stability methods including Routh-Hurwitz criterion and the root locus method. Design of PID controllers and compensators in the time- and s-plain domains. Introduction to frequency response methods (utilizing Bode, Nyquist and Nichols diagrams) for determining closed-loop stability, gain and phase margins. Loop shaping, phase lead and phase lag compensators design. Prerequisites: ME2502 or ME2503 and MA2121. The course also assumes some basic knowledge of the MATLAB/Simulink modeling environment (AE2440).
