function [ path, path_length ] = shortestPath_Mazza( A, start, dest )
% Find and return the shortest path for a directed graph
%   Implements Dijkstra's slgorithm to find and return the shortest path of
%   A from start to dest.
%
%   INPUTS: A (adjacency matrix), start (node in A), dest (node in A)
%   RETURNS: path (vector of nodes in A), path_length (double)
%
% Lemma: subpaths of the shortest path are shortest paths.
