%Instructions
%Complete both parts of the assignment below. Submit your assignments using this assignment feature as a Word or PDF attachment.
%
%Part 1. Choose any two UML diagrams of different types. You may use any diagrams - from the web, your work, or construct your own (please cite your reference). The two diagrams must be of different types (class, sequence, activity, etc), but can be as simple or complex as you desire (I'd go with simple). Using the diagrams, complete the following:
%What type of diagram is this?
%What kind of information is conveyed using a diagram of this type (in general, not in this specific application)?
%Stepping through each entity, connector, and symbol, express in written english the precise meaning of the diagram. (Yep, you can change your original idea and use a simple diagram now...).
%Part 2. Short Paper Assignment: Consider the three papers in this week's reading assignment and write a short paper (350-700 words, or about half a page to one page) addresssing the following:
%Summarize briefly the main ideas or themes of two of the papers. (Just a couple of sentences will do if they capture the essence of the papers.)
%What parts of each paper did you agree with? What parts did you disagree with? How do the statements made in the papers measure up with your experience? (This should be the bulk of your paper - I am interested in your reaction to the ideas based on your experience/knowledge.)
%At the end of your paper, include one or two discussion questions you have based on your thoughts and ideas while completing the assignment. (These questions will normally be used during class to stimulate discussions, but they also help you solidify your thoughts. If you can compose an interesting question about a topic, it reveals that you understand the concepts.)
