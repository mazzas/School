\begin{document}
\maketitle

% Make 2 parts per section: first about the technology in general and second about the Army's use of it.
\section*{Technology Description}
% Describe the technology and include pictures, drawings, or other illustrations as appropriate.
Smart phones are the result of the intersection of several mature and emerging consumer technologies including <list technologies>.  The smart phone revolution started in <name the date> with the introduction of the BlackBerry <model?>.  Fueled by consumer demand, Microsoft and Palm entered the market.  But it wasn't until Apple introduced the iPhone that the revolution fully took hold.  No longer just the tools of the business elite, now these devices were actively marketed to the average consumer \emdash equally at home in the boardroom and in your kid's backpack.

\section*{Technological Need}
% What are the needs the technology fulfills – think back to SE3100 when you did a capability needs analysis.  Define and/or model as appropriate the needs (wants) the technology fulfills.  What functions does the technology provide?  How does it fit into its environment?

\section*{Evolution of the Technology}
% How has the technology evolved over its history?  Research when the technology was first introduced, how it was introduced, and its major milestones over the technology’s lifetime.

\section*{Technologically Enabling Advances}
% What technical advances in related or component technologies enable this technology?  What knowledge is associated with the development of the technology? (e.g., mechanical knowledge, nuclear, …)

\section*{Variants of the Technology}
% Are there variants of the same technology?  If so, what are the differences/similarities of those variants?  (e.g., automobile technology, there are variants in engine type, transmission, etc.).  Variants indicate either different needs, different prioritization of needs, or different solution approaches to the same problem.

\section*{Technology Diffusion}
% Explain the mechanisms and timing of how the technology diffused through the market, military, or society?  How long did it take to be adopted?

\section*{Growth Rate}
% What has been the growth rate of the technology?  Define appropriate measures of effectiveness and/or performance and determine its growth rate.  For example, for automobiles you could look at mpg, average service life, reliability, and other relevant measures.

\section*{Forecast}
% Forecast likely scenarios of where the technology will be 10 – 20 years from today; and/or create a technology roadmap of where the main stakeholders would likely want the technology to be.
