% You have two options on how to structure your thesis:
% a) Do your thesis in this single file.  All chapters, sections, etc. go in this file.
%    This can make navigating your thesis a little more difficult.
% b) Use multiple files.  One chapter per file is recommended.
%    This breaks your thesis up into logical units to edit.

\include{chapter1}
% include other chapters here.
\include{appendix1}
% include other appendices here.

% Change the bibliographystyle to match your Department's preference.
