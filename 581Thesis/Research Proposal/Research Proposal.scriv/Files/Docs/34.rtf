\f0\fs28 \cf0 We had a very difficult meeting tonight.  Skype did not hold out and Elluminate was only marginally better.  The purpose of the meeting was for Kristin to walk though her EFFBD diagram with Dr. Auguston in order to get some feedback and provide a status on the construction of her model.  The goal was to create an EFFBD that fully captured the MP model they had been sharing.  Specific problems with the EFFBD model included loop synchronization and termination criteria.\
I think there must be a way to affect this easily within CORE but don\'92t know enough about CORE to be very useful.  It\'92s entirely possible at any rate that we may start using {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://Innoslate.com"}}{\fldrslt Innoslate.com}} instead.  This would be great for me since I\'92m on OS X and CORE is only available for Windows.}
