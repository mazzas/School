<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Abstract<br/>
Insert the abstract here. The abstract should summarize your research in clear and concise language. You should write your abstract with the idea that it may be the only section that will actually be read and the sole representation of your research. <br/>
<br/>
Some primary factors that you should consider for the abstract:<br/>
<br/>
Motivation: Why do we care?<br/>
Problem statement: What are you trying to address?<br/>
Approach: How will you address the problem?<br/>
Results: What is the answer or expected answer?<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>Introduction<br/>
Introduction to the research including background, current research in the area, etc.</p>
</li>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Purpose</strong><br/>Purpose or Hypothesis<br/>
The purpose or hypothesis of the research. This is a more general overview of your research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Research Question</strong><br/>Research Question(s)<br/>
Insert your specific and answerable research question(s) here. Bullet points are OK. The idea is to be as clear as possible.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Importance</strong><br/>Importance of the Project<br/>
The importance of the research including what makes your research unique and/or the specific contribution you seek to make.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Method of Approach</strong><br/>Method of Approach<br/>
The research methodology you will employ including location, data collection techniques, analysis techniques, etc.</p>
</li>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Work Plan</strong><br/>Work Plan<br/>
This is arguably the most important part of the proposal as it shows how you will conduct your study. As such, it should be as realistic as possible and very detailed. For my proposal I broke it down by what I intended to accomplish each month.<br/>
<br/>
August<br/>
1. Determine survey questions<br/>
<br/>
October<br/>
2. IRB request - 2 months<br/>
3. Meet with committee<br/>
<br/>
November<br/>
4. Mail surveys<br/>
5. Data Entry<br/>
6. Submit abstract for professional conference paper or poster presentation<br/>
<br/>
December<br/>
7. Data Entry<br/>
<br/>
January<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Budget</strong><br/>Budget<br/>
This should be as detailed as possible but simple to understand. A simple table with line items should suffice. Any descriptions or justifications can be done below the table.<br/>
