	Abstract = {This paper suggests an approach to formal software and systems architecture specification based on behavior models. The behavior of a system is defined as a set of events (event trace) with two basic relations: precedence and inclusion. The structure of an event trace is specified using event grammars and other constraints organized into schemas. Behaviors for both system and its environment can be specified within the same framework. Suggested composition operations on schemas are based on event pattern matching and provide for behavior merging and abstract interface specification. The schema framework is amenable to stepwise refinement, reuse, visualization of multiple architecture views, and application of automated tools for consistency checks and system behavior verification early in the design process. },
