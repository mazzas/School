To address the factors inhibiting the adoption and implementation of HSI principles the text lays out the following recommendations:
	1) require ship programs use human systems integration to establish crew size goals and help achieve them
	2) clearly define the human systems integration certification standards for new ships
	3) formally establish a policy evaluation function to examine and facilitate the adoption of cost-saving technologies and best practices across Navy systems.

Additionally, recommendations for Executive Action suggest that the Secretary of the Navy should require for all new Navy systems
	1) a human system integration assessment be performed as concepts for the system are developed and alternative concepts are evaluated
	2) human systems integration analyses, including trade-off studies of design alternatives, be used to establish an optimized crew size goal that will become a key performance parameter in the program's requirements document
	3) human systems integration assessments be updated prior to all subsequent milestones

Lastly, specific steps are urged in a section titled "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation" which stipulates that HSI is to be addressed in
	1) a specific plan before the acquisition's earliest milestone
	2) the initial capabilities document
	3) the capabilities development document
	4) assessments performed as part of concept exploration and development and updated prior to all subsequent milestones
	
All of these recommendations and observations point to the fact that incpororating HSI into systems engineering efforts is a cultural and systemic initiative that requires a firm commitment to long-term conservation of resources and money often in exchange for short-term increases in spending, strong backing across the organization and up and down the chain of command, clear direction regarding engineering trade-offs, and visionary leadership.

Since the report has been published there have been several notable examples of engineering efforts that leverage HSI principles.

MANPRINT is the Army's HSI program and has been applied to the Comanche helicopter program where it will help save $3.29B in operating and support costs.

SEAPRINT is the Navy's HSI program which, according to the text, is a
	a) philosophy based on the premise that manpower and human performance are design drivers, not design consequences,
	b) technical approach that integrates analyses among the domains of HSI, and between HSI analyses and the systems engineering and acquisition process, and
	c) emerging set of tools that will enable PMs to execute the required HSI activities in a resource effective manner.
		
In related efforts, British Type 23 and Dutch M-Class Frigates achieved 30 - 40 percent reduction in crew size by utilizing HSI principles.
	
Commercial examples include the incorporation of rear-centered brake lights in American automobile production.
	
Furthermore, I am specifically aware that in the development that we do on commercial hand held devices we place high emphasis on human interface design, a subset of HSI.  Time spent on this translates very directly to acceptance of our products by warfighters and reduction in training costs which significantly reduces the total life cycle costs.  In the development of applications designed for smart phones and tablets we have benefited considerably by the guidelines established by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple.  Furthermore, we get a lot of mileage from involving the end user early and often in the development process.  This involvement is in both evaluation of ongoing effort and informing our implementation of the work flow.
