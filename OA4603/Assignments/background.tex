\begin{document}
\maketitle

I work for CERDEC under the Command, Power, and Integration (CP\&I) Directorate and am currently the Architecture Lead for the Mission Command Technology Enabled Technology Demonstration (MC TECD).  I previously spent 15 years in private industry and have worked for the Army since early 2010.  I just completed the 311 DL Systems Engineering program and am anxious to continue my education at NPS.

By far, most of my experience pertains to software engineering.  I currently oversee development that includes integrated unit testing, automated builds, continuous integration and delivery, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

My capstone work in the 311 SE program used a fair amount of statistical analysis including nearly orthogonal Latin hypercube (NOLH) reduction of parameters for evaluating ground combat system design for the Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE).\footnote{Special thanks to Professor Hernandez for his assistance in understanding this process.}
